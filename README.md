# ARCANGEL-X-LEGION
ARCANGEL EP X LEGION is a simple yet sophisticated multi-agent equipped, State-Managed intelligence system pushing the limits of abstract reasoning and decision making. Designed to solve the Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenges through cognitive refinement, its lean, modular codebase implements advanced cognitive algorithms—dynamic memory management and non-linear state transitions—rooted in Active Inference. The system further employs advanced belief updating, distress modulation, specialized pattern recognition, requirement equation driven subsystems to continuously adapt and optimize performance.
